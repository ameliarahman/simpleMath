Kuis Perhitungan Operasi Matematika

A simple program to calculate 10 random numbers with simple Mathematic operations. Since it was built by the simple javascript, this program is still being developed for better.
Anyone can use this program to help their 3-4th-grader-sisters/brothers in learning basic Mathematic as I did to my little sister :)
